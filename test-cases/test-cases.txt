Boostly — Manual Test Cases

Prereqs
- Start server: `python src/app.py`
- Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000

1) Recognition
- Steps:
  1. Create two students: Alice and Bob.
  2. Fetch Alice to view sending balance and monthly limit.
  3. Send a recognition from Alice -> Bob for 10 credits with a message.
  4. Fetch Alice again to see reduced available_credits and increased monthly_sent.
  5. Fetch Bob to see increased received_balance.
- Expected:
  - Recognition succeeds (201) and returns recognition_id.
  - Alice available_credits decreases by 10, monthly_sent increases by 10.
  - Bob received_balance increases by 10.
  - Sending more than Alice's remaining available credits or remaining monthly limit returns 400.

2) Endorsements
- Steps:
  1. Create a third student: Carol.
  2. Endorse Bob's received recognition using Carol as endorser.
  3. Try to endorse the same recognition again with Carol.
- Expected:
  - First endorsement succeeds (201); total_endorsements increases to 1.
  - Second endorsement returns 409 with error about endorsing only once.
  - Endorsements do not change any credit balances.

3) Redemption
- Steps:
  1. Fetch Bob to confirm received_balance (>= 10 from earlier).
  2. Redeem 5 credits for Bob.
  3. Fetch Bob again to verify received_balance decreased by 5.
- Expected:
  - Redemption succeeds (201) and returns voucher_value_in_inr = 5 * amount.
  - Bob received_balance reduces accordingly.
  - Attempting to redeem more than available returns 400.

4) Credit Reset (Month Change)
- Steps:
  1. Create a new student: Dan.
  2. Immediately fetch Dan; note available_credits = 100, monthly_sent = 0.
  3. Simulate new month (manually update DB or wait) OR call `/admin/reset_month` after changing system month for testing.
  4. For an existing student with unused credits > 50, verify only 50 carry forward.
  5. For an existing student with < 50 unused, verify exact carry forward.
- Expected:
  - After reset, available_credits = 100 + min(previous_unused, 50).
  - monthly_sent resets to 0.
  - Remaining monthly limit becomes 100.

5) Leaderboard
- Steps:
  1. Ensure several recognitions exist to multiple recipients.
  2. Call `/leaderboard?limit=5`.
  3. Verify order by total_credits_received desc; tie broken by student_id asc.
  4. Verify recognitions_count and endorsements_count look correct.
- Expected:
  - Correct ranking, with totals reflecting lifetime credits received (not reduced by redemption).

Optional: Use the UI at `/` to perform each action with forms.
